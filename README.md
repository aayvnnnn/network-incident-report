# Network Incident Report

## Introduction

An incident report (of a specific network log) for a fictional IT company. Completed as a part of my cybersecurity portfolio and as a part of the <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/networks-and-network-security?specialization=cybersecurity-certificate'>Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security</a> course in Google's <a href='https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate'>Cybersecurity Professional Certificate</a> on <a href='https://www.coursera.org/'>Coursera</a>..

The goal is to analyze a tcpdump log that contains information regarding a recent incident that prompted problems in the client company's website, determine the protocol that was affected during this event, and aggregate a report that explains the matter in a clear and structured format.
